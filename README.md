## Introduction:

An AR-based app where users can virtually "try-out" furniture at their home. A USER can select a discrete piece of furniture from the inventory and can virtually give it a try in their homes.

Through the e-commerce website design, we will create a Home page of an eCommerce website with a banner section, some idiosyncratic images, then some featured products with the product outlay and statuette.

We can peddle these apps and websites to domestic furniture businesses...
We can increase the peculiarity, where a user can customize his/her furniture from the app and we can also link the website to the app. It will be more fathomable.
